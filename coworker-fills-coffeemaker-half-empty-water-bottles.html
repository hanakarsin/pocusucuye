And one day while you're going to get your third cup of free coffee for the day cause why not, you see one of your coworkers with four or five half drank bottles of water, pouring the water into the coffee machine, so you say, 'Hey what're you doing? 'Cause that looks unsanitary.'"</p><p>After sharing that she saw her coworker pour the backwash water into the coffee machine, Nay continued with her anecdote: "And she proceeds to tell you, 'Yeah, I gave three customers some bottles of water earlier today, and when I walked around the rooms, I realized nobody drank all of them."</p><p>According to the TikToker, her coworker thought it would be a good idea to create a random client mouth germ cocktail and dump it into the workplace's coffee machine: "'And they were like half drunk so I just decided to put them in the coffee pot so we can make some fresh coffee.' And you look at her like: What the f--- did you just say?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @supernovanb</span></figure><p>Clearly, Nay was not happy about their coworker taking such an environmentally conscious approach to making cups of coffee while at work: "'Cause you think you're having a stroke cause no way in the world did she just say what she just said so you ask her to repeat herself."</p><p>Unfortunately, her repetition request didn't clarify what she probably hoped was a misunderstanding, but just reinforced the horrifying news she initially heard: "And she says, 'Yeah, I always do this. I've been doing this for a long time. If I ever see a bottle of water lying around and I don't see anybody drinking it, I just take it and I put it into the coffee pot."</p><p>Nay didn't appreciate the answer: "So now you're on Amazon trying to find a detox or something because you've been drinking tuberculosis and backwash for the last six months." Still holding her hand up to the camera she puts a finger down before her clip cuts out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @supernovanb</span></figure><p>She added in a caption for her video: "I think I got mesothelioma,"<strong> </strong>and there were other folks who responded to her video that they, too, were grossed out by her co-worker's water re-purposing habits.</p><p>There was one person who wrote that she should probably contact the company's human resources department straight away: "HR IMMEDIATELY!!!" they said.</p><p>Another said that if she wanted to make sure the water wasn't going to waste, she could've simply saved it for any plants that they had in the office: "That‚Äôs plant water!!!!"</p><p>Someone else thought that she should've gone straight to get blood work done to ensure she wasn't ill: "Schedule a doctor's appointment with blood work IMMEDIATELY," they said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @supernovanb</span></figure><p>Another said that they would've had such an intense reaction that human resources wouldn't have been enough. "At that point, I'm in jail, HR can't help nobody," they wrote.</p><p>Someone else said that this would've been a good time to invoke FMLA and get some time off while they attended to any potential health issues that could've arisen as a result of drinking the water: "But did you report her to HR and proceed to take FMLA??"</p><p>Turns out that Nay wasn't the only person who's been dealing with an unsanitary co-worker, another TikTok user replied to her video, stating that they had an office cup-sharing vandal who gave Nay's water re-purposer a run for her money: "Brah I found out a coworker had been using my personal mug and then cleaning it out with his hand and hand sanitizer. I almost died."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLy4u9GknKtllp65rb%2BMnKafnpWauqK3xKtkoZmcm3qmuc%2BtsGavkamys3nBqKutpJWo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./20-killed-5000-displaced-as-gunmen-attack-12-nasarawa-communities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Killed, 5,000 Displaced As Gunmen Attack 12 Nasarawa Communities">&larr;
