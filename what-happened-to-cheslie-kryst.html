A successful attorney, media personality, and Extra correspondent, Cheslie passed away in the last days of January 2022. What happened?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cheslie Kryst, the winner of Miss USA 2019, has died aged 30.</h2><p>"In devastation and great sorrow, we share the passing of our beloved Cheslie," Cheslie's family shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>. "Her great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength. She cared, she loved, she laughed, and she shined."</p><p>"Cheslie embodied love and served others, whether through her work as an attorney fighting for social justice, as Miss USA and as a host on Extra," they added. "But most importantly, as a daughter, sister, friend, mentor, and colleague — we know her impact will live on."</p><p>While there has been speculation about suicide as the cause of Cheslie's death, it appears that the rumors are true. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reports that the NYC Chief Medical Examiner has ruled that Cheslie's death has been officially ruled a suicide.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cheslie's mom, April Simpkins, has broken her silence about her daughter's death.</h2><p>As the devastating news about Cheslie's death continues to make its rounds online, her mother, April Simpkins, model and the winner of Miss North Carolina USA in 2002, has broken her silence. In a tear-jerking Instagram post, April explains how deeply she's been affected by Cheslie's unexpected death.</p><p>"I have never known a pain as deep as this. I am forever changed," April wrote. "Today, what our family and friends privately knew was the cause of death of my sweet baby girl, Cheslie, was officially confirmed. While it may be hard to believe, it’s true. Cheslie led both a public and a private life. In her private life, she was dealing with high-functioning depression which she hid from everyone — including me, her closest confidant — until very shortly before her death."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by April (@aprils_hr)</a></p></figure><p>She continued to share how infectious Cheslie's personality was and how vital she was in their family unit. The grieving mother also shared that Cheslie was much more than her daughter, but her very best friend.</p><p>April continued, "I love you baby girl with all my heart. I miss you desperately. I know one day we’ll be together again. Until then, rest easy and in peace."</p><p>April closed out the tribute post by thanking people for respecting the family's privacy as they grieve and asked for folks to "make a donation to Dress for Success, an organization that was dear to her heart," as opposed to sending flowers. Cheslie served as an ambassador for Dress for Success Charlotte, an organization helping women achieve economic independence.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cheslie Kryst appears to have left behind a suicide note.</h2><p>Cheslie left behind a note, according to outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>.
