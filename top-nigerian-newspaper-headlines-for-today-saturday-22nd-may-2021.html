style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today Saturday, 22nd May 2021.</h2><p>The Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Attahiru has reportedly died in a military plane crash which occurred in Kaduna State.</p><p>The incident occurred on Friday at the Kaduna International Airport according to military sources.</p><p>It was learnt that the ill-fated aircraft crashed at the airport’s runway about 6 pm and about eight people on board are all feared dead.</p><p>Naija News had reported that the leader of the Boko Haram terrorist group, Abubakar Shekau was reportedly killed according to multiple sources.</p><p>Information gathered has it that Shekau died on the evening of Wednesday, 19th May 2021.</p><p>He was said to have died following the invasion of his Sambisa forest stronghold by fighters of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS).</p><p>ISWAP was a part of the Boko Haram group before it broke away in 2016 over ideological differences and pledged allegiance to ISIS – an international terrorist organization.</p><p>It was gathered that the ISWAP fighters stormed Shekau’s stronghold on Wednesday with multiple gun trucks and overpowered the Boko Haram fighters including Shekau’s bodyguards leading to the death of fighters on both sides.</p><p>The commissioners of police in Abuja and Plateau State have been warned by the acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to be on alert over imminent attacks by Boko Haram members.</p><p>The alert was contained in a circular forwarded to the two commissioners of police and signed by the Principal Staff Officer to the IGP, Idowu Owohunwa, an acting CP.</p><p>The IGP noted that an intelligence report revealed that terrorists are planning to attack Abuja and Jos.</p><p>The circular with reference number TB: 0900/IGP.SEC/ABJ/VOL.TI/47 was titled ‘Terror elements to expand frontiers of attack.’</p><p>Reports have emerged on Friday of another gas explosion at the premises of the CSCC construction yard, at the Onikoko area of Abeokuta, Ogun State.</p><p>Naija News reports that this is coming barely 24 hours after explosion rocked the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library in the state capital.</p><p>According to reports, the latest explosion left two people seriously injured and needing medical attention at a nearby hospital.</p><p>The Federal Government has asked Nigerians to shun reports of an impending increase in the price of Premium Motor Spirit, better known as petrol, in June.</p><p>Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, made this known in a press statement on Friday while responding to the recommendation of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) that the price of petrol should be deregulated.</p><p>The governors also recommended that a litre price of fuel should be between N408.5 and N380, adding that fuel subsidy should be immediately removed.</p><p>According to the governors, the current arrangement of subsidy payment is “unsustainable”, and only smugglers and illegal marketers benefit from it.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of new members of the National Governing Board for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).</p><p>Naija News reports that the appointment was contained in a statement by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development titled ‘President Buhari appoints NYSC board.’</p><p>Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State has revealed why his Cross Rivers State counterpart, Ben Ayade, defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>Speaking with State House Correspondents after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari, at the Presidential Villa on Friday, Ishaku said the PDP did its best to persuade him to stay.</p><p>He said: “Well, I wouldn’t know precisely the governor’s thinking, because all of us are different, but we are greatly shocked and embarrassed that he will suddenly dump the party for APC because all of us see PDP as an alternative to APC and all the PDP governors are doing very well in their respective states.”</p><p>The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said that subscribers are not required to submit the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of their phones to it from July 2021.</p><p>Naija News had reported that the directive is to be implemented within three months, as contained in the revised National Identity Policy for SIM card registration which was released on May 11, 2021.</p><p>However, Nigerians took to social media to condemn the commission for asking Nigerians to submit their phone identification numbers to it from July.</p><p>Reacting to the reports, NCC’s Director of Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, said at no time did the commission issue a statement regarding the registration of IMEI by subscribers and it has no plans to do so.</p><p>The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has confirmed the crash of a military plane on Friday at the Kaduna International Airport.</p><p>Confirming the crash, the NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet said the immediate cause of the crash is still being ascertained but promised to release more details soon.</p><p>As previously reported by Naija News, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Ibrahim Attahiru is believed to have died in the plane crash.</p><p>Apart from the COAS, seven others were also said to have been on board the ill-fated aircraft.</p><p>The US State Department, on Thursday, noted that the Islamic State in West Africa Province, ISWAP, will not get the $7 million bounty placed on the leader of Boko Haram sect, Abubakar Shekau.</p><p>The State Department while reacting to the reports on the death of Shekau, said the bounty is not meant for a group under ISIS.</p><p>“News reports today indicate that Boko Haram terrorist Abubakar Shekau blew himself up in a confrontation with ISIS affiliates. Hey, ISIS guys. To clarify: no – you are not eligible for the reward for information on his identity or location. That’s not how the program works,” the US State Department for justice tweeted.</p><p>The U.S. Department of State on June 21, 2012, tagged Shekau a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224.</p><p>One year later, a $7 million bounty was placed on him.</p><h2><strong>That’s the top Nig</strong><strong>erian newspaper headl</strong><strong>in</strong><strong>es for to</strong><strong>day.
