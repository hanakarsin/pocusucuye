We then sought to find out what was delaying the process only for the INEC officials to tell us that they just received a letter that the party wrote INEC at the close of work notifying it that they received a notice of appeal from my co-contestant.</p><p>“So it is on the strength of that notice of appeal that the party will no longer hold the re-run primary election as scheduled, therefore postponing this election without a new date fixed. This is highly disappointing and the manner by which they postponed the re-run is not encouraging.”</p><h2>It Takes A Court Order To Vacate Another Court Order</h2><p>Magaji, however, while interacting with newsmen on Saturday said apart from the manner in which the party postponed the rerun election, he was perplexed by the action of the party because, from his experience as a lawyer, it takes an order of the court to vacate another order of a court.</p><p>“We were happy when we saw that our own party was attempting to comply with a court order only for the same party to rely on ordinary notice of appeal, a mere intention, to postpone the re-run. How can that appeal supersede a valid court order?</p><p>“The curious part was that no effort was made by the party to apologize to delegates and party loyalists whose time, resources and energy they have put in disarray with the postponement; instead the party apologized to INEC for any inconvenience caused by the postponement”, he said.</p><p>He then urged the party to arrange the re-run before the November 16 deadline set by the court, adding that the hearing of the appeal can go on without stopping the re-run primary election.</p><p>Magaji also urged delegates and supporters to remain peaceful and law-abiding and assured them that steps would be taken in line with the law to address the postponement of the re-run primary election to ensure it was held within the 14 days set by the court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BsZpqok2K9sL%2FTqaannaNiv6Z50a6lZqiinrqivthmnKWdk6m2sLqMoqVmppGorrOt1ppm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./audie-murphy-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Audie Murphy - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr;
