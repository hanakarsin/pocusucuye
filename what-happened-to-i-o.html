His Twitter account posted a message for fans, sharing, "On Monday, November 23rd, the world lost a beautiful soul, Garrett Falls Lockhart, also known as i_o. This extremely talented spirit taught us that even if nothing matters, you can still lead with love. Garrett's truth and soul lives on through the music he shared. Rest in peace, Garrett. We love you."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YT5r8tVA9y</a></p>‚Äî i_o (@i_oofficial) <a href=#>November 24, 2020</a></figure><p>Exactly one day prior to his death, i_o posted a flashback to a rave in Los Angeles. "1 year ago today / &nbsp;acid rave los angeles," he wrote, sharing a video of one of his sets. He'd also been promoting his new trance cover, "Castles in the Sky."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Castles In The Sky (Official Video)<a href=#>https://t.co/imSDdU42Pm</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BRQ5GFzcds</a></p>‚Äî i_o (@i_oofficial) <a href=#>November 22, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to i_o?</h2><p>Shortly after the news of i_o's death, many fans speculate that the 30-year-old DJ took his own life. Someone replied to the announcement about his passing with a screengrab of an Instagram caption i_o posted six days ago which stated, "do u ever question ur life?" The Twitter user wrote, "this is why you should always check in on your friends. read his caption (posted a week ago)."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is why you should always check in on your friends. read his caption (posted a week ago) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nLSqy0xz2Z</a></p>‚Äî bryüêú (@brolandes) <a href=#>November 24, 2020</a></figure><p>On November 19, 2020, Garrett posted a meme with the caption "me and my serotonin first festival back," and replied to himself saying "the joke here is that i have no serotonin."

One of his recent songs, "In My Head" explores mental health, specifically depression and anxiety. Garrett opened up to The Nocturnal Times, saying, "'<a href=# rel=nofollow>In My Head' reflects on depression</a> and the lengths you go to quell the warped anxiety and polar ups and downs. I wrote this after I'd been up every night until 8 a.m. for what felt like months. It'd been a while since I'd played a show, and I didn't realize what kind of high I had been riding until touring stopped abruptly in March 2020."</p><p>He continued, "I really wanted to write something uplifting, but the chords got more and more melancholy and the progression got more and more tense. Finally, I was left with a top-line that repeated over and over, an ironic rapture that was contrary to the heavy-heartedness I was going through."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Fans have flocked to social media to express their condolences. "Shocking and terrible news. Extremely talented artist and great human. Lots of love and prayers to his family and loved ones," the founder of electronic music event promoter Insomniac, Pasquale Rotella, wrote on his Instagram. A fan wrote, "This is so upsetting. I hope you find peace Garrett." Loud Luxury posted, "a beautiful and incredible soul. rest in power [Garrett]" RIP, Garrett. This is truly a huge loss for his family and friends, as well as the world.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Medical examiners determined i_o's cause of death was Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</h2><p>Eventually, the LA County Medical Examiner determined<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> i_o's cause of death</a> to be Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder involving chronic inflammation of the thyroid. The report also notes that Garrett died at his home. In light of the update surrounding Garrett's death, his fans have again started posting messages of mourning and support for his friends and family.
