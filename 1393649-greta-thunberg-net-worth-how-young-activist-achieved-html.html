The 18-year-old has since then received plenty of media attention for her hard-hitting contributions to the debate. One more thing that has piqued the interest of her fans is the issue of her net worth. How wealthy is she? And where does she get the money to do all the things she has been doing?

She is a global icon, and for all the right reasons. But what did Greta Thunberg do to get so famous? The teen climate activist rose to fame in August 2018 when she started skipping school to protest climate change inaction outside of the Swedish parliament.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/23e3fb123badf737.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fashion tips for special kids' mums: Singer Jodie shares stylish low budget look</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She held a sign </a>that read <i>'Skolstrejk för klimatet (School strike for the climate)' </i>with the goal of convincing the government to take action against global warming.
