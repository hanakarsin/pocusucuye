And till date, the promise is well kept as workers and our senior citizens get their entitlement as and when due.</p><p>“I also promised to embark on developmental projects and this is evident in the areas of roads rehabilitation, health, education, youth empowerment, as well provision of free monthly food for vulnerable groups, among others.</p><p>“Aside from Olaiya flyover, which is waiting for the inauguration, we had embarked on other road rehabilitation and reconstruction across the state.</p><p>” We recently approved repairs of 25 roads, spanning 200 kilometres in the state.</p><p>“On our free monthly food distribution, over 300,000 vulnerable households have benefitted from it since inception and we will not stop.</p><p>” In the area of health intervention, we rehabilitated, revitalised, renovated and upgraded.332 focal Primary Healthcare Centres across the state.</p><p>“The administration had distributed drugs worth N50 million across the state Primary Healthcare facilities as well as several new beds to all health facilities across the state, among others.</p><p>“If you give me your support again, which I believe you will, these good works will never stop but rather expect more of such.”</p><p>Oyetola, who appreciated the people of the state for their support and prayers for his administration, urged them not to allow ‘kindergarten politicians’ to deceive them with fake promises.</p><p>“You have tested me for close to four years now and you can see that I have not in any way failed you. I urge you not to allow kindergarten politicians, who are not tested to deceive you.</p><p>” Let’s join hands to ensure continuity for the benefits and greater of Osun, which we will all be proud of”, he said.</p><p>The governor also urged them to keep their voter cards well, adding that it is their power to ensure continuity of good work come July 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49wZqirpaN6c3yRa2SiZZSku7V5zrCcZq%2Bfp7imvtJmqpqkkae2pr%2BMrqWloZuaerS7zJ5kqZ2fpbmmec6ynK2nnJZ8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./apc-releases-timetable-for-congresses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="APC Releases Timetable For Congresses">&larr;
