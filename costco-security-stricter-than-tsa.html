Just this month Costco recently started requiring that at self-checkout you show your Costco membership card and the employee verifies that you're the same person on your card."</p><p>He went on: "Just like Netflix I think Costco's realizing there's a lot of people sharing memberships. Do you think this is gonna be the new normal at Costco? I think it probably will be but that's my opinion."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@butthatsmyopinion href=#>@butthatsmyopinion</a><p>What do you think of the new Costco Membership changes? <a title=costcofinds href=#>#costcofinds</a> <a title=costcodrama href=#>#costcodrama</a> <a title=costco href=#>#costco</a></p><a title="♬ sound credit to pdnlz - fourthattempt7" href=#>♬ sound credit to pdnlz - fourthattempt7</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @butthatsmyopinion</span></figure><p>Judging from the comments in response to his video, and a stitched video from another TikToker named Willa (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@willaiego</a>), it would appear that there are a number of folks who are already feeling the burn of Costco's new, stricter membership-checking policies that seem even more stringent than @butthatsmyopinion suggested.</p><p>Willa says in a video of her own: "This new Costco policy thing just reminds me of one time when my husband and I who we both are on one membership together with both cards we went to Costco together but I had my Costco card but no money and he had money but no Costco card with him."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@willaeigo href=#>@willaeigo</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @butthatsmyopinion I obviously love costco but this was next level insane. <a title=costco href=#>#costco</a> <a title=costcomembership href=#>#costcomembership</a> <a title=costcosecurity href=#>#costcosecurity</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Willa" href=#>♬ original sound - Willa</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @willaiego</span></figure><p>She continued, "and so we get to the checkout and I had them scan my Costco card and then he was going to pay. Obviously, we are together we are married."</p><p>However, it turns out that the Costco employee working the cash register had some very specific instructions for the couple trying to give its business money.</p><p>"And the checkout person said no you have to pay for it. And I looked at her and I said bestie I don't have any money with me and he's my husband obviously he can pay."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @willaiego</span></figure><p>You would figure that maybe the entire situation could've just been chalked up to the fact that there was a misunderstanding and the Costco employee in question didn't know that the two of them were together.</p><p>However, this wasn't the case, as Willa says the worker insisted that she be the one to pay for the items: "And she's like no because it's not his card."</p><p>Willa goes on to say that the worker got their supervisor to investigate the situation: "She called over the manager he came over and he was like, took my husband's ID and my Costco card to the back and scanned them to see if my husband was actually on my Costco account."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @willaiego</span></figure><p>Willa continued, "He was. Came back and was like okay, you're good."</p><p>But the TikToker said that the situation was anything but good: "10 minutes we held up the entire line for a solid 10 minutes doing that. Costco security is tighter than TSA.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @willaiego</span></figure><p>Have you ever experienced something like this while shopping at Costco? Seems kind of strange that they would force her to pay for the items — it's not like folks just can't get the money from someone else before stepping into the store and the behavior does appear to be petty on the worker's part.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLy0wMKoZKydk6q%2FqsDYZqqtqpmYwaa%2BjK2fmqZdqcCi</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jackson-duggar-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Remember Little Jackson Duggar?
