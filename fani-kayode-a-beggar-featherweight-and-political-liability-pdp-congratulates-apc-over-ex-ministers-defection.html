Have the unemployed Nigerians been employed under Buhari? Has Buhari now been able to curb the killing spree of Nigerian soldiers and kidnappings of innocent citizens by bandits and herders across the country?</p><p>“For some of us and especially the South-West PDP, we knew the featherweight politician would defect to the APC because we had always been aware of his insincerity and unholy alliance. We in South-West PDP are the most grateful because the snitch within has finally gone home to roast (sic). We predicted earlier that those sabotaging the progress of this country will be exposed; now, Nigerians have seen it and we are vindicated</p><p>“FFK should not be taken seriously. Even when he was acting as a self-acclaimed PDP spokesman, many of us knew he wasn’t sincere. He was then PDP in the day and APC in the night. FFK lacks the integrity required to portray a liberator’s stature. He is a political beggar whose only source of income is in corporate begging.</p><p>“Over the years, FFK has remained a worthless entity within the party and especially in South-West. History has it that FFK has never won any election even in his polling unit for PDP other than scavenging for political relevance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BxZp%2BZnp56rK3YqJueZZFir6azxpqpZp6VlsGpsdGwnKKfmKl6orrDZqeopJmptqSty2ajopmSnrmqwNhmp52oXZi8r7PRmquupJGpsrR5wKmaZqemmr9usddmpKKmmajBpr7SZpuenpWYwaq7zWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./social-distance-holiday-potluck-ideas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holiday Potluck Ideas That Still Follow Social Distance Guidelines">&larr;
