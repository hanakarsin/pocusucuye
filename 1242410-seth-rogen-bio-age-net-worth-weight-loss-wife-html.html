He also has a sibling, his sister Danya Rogen. The actor acquired both Canadian and American citizenship due to his parents. His father is an American while his mother is a Canadian.</p><p class=align-left>Growing up, he attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and later he studied at the Point Grey Secondary School for his high school education. All through his childhood, the future actor knew that he wanted to be a comedian and thus he began doing stand up comedy during his teens. This led to him dropping out of school early in a bid to pursue his comedic dreams. In 1998 at the tender age of 16, he won the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest</a>. From here, he started acting in TV roles with his first role being a small part in Judd Apatow's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">short-lived series</a>. In 2003, he wrote for the TV series Da Ali G Show. He and his fellow writers received an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Emmy nomination</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0058c62935d41e62.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Reynolds biography: Age, height, net worth, wife, kids</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These small wins became career launch pads for Seth. In 2005, he was part of the greatest comedy movies of the time, and thus Seth Rogen's name was known worldwide. While he only had a small part in the film, he did co-produce it, and the movie is most certainly an iconic one in the comedy genre.</p><p class=align-left>From here on, he has gone on to act, write and produce more amazing movies such as Sausage Party, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Knocked Up</a>, Pineapple Express, Superbad, Kung Fu Panda among <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">many others</a>. He has also gone on to voice animated characters in animations such as Horton Hears a Who! American Dad as well as The Simpsons.</p><h2>Seth Rogen Lion King</h2><p class=align-left>In late 2017, Disney announced that they were going to be re-making their much-beloved movie, The Lion King.
