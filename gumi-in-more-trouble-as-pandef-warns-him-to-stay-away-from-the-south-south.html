It must, therefore, show the will and courage to take immediate steps to give the country a rebirth through restructuring for peace, security, and development.”</p><p>Earlier, <strong>Naija News</strong> also reported that the youth wing of the Ohanaeze group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>called on security operatives to arrest Sheikh Ahmad Gumi</a></strong> immediately.</p><p>This is as the youth wing of the Igbo socio-cultural group alleged that the popular Islamic cleric is providing support for terrorists troubling Nigeria and deserves to be arrested with them.</p><p>The OYC in its submission also condemned the statement credited to Gumi in a recent interview with BBC pidgin, where he was reported to have compared late Igbo leader, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu with the bandits.</p><p>Similarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>accused President Muhammadu Buhari of supporting the position of Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi</a></strong> by keeping silent on remarks credited to the cleric.</p><p>CAN in a statement on Wednesday said the President should have called Gumi to order over his statement where he claimed Christian soldiers were the ones killing Muslim bandits and insurgents to cause problems in the country.</p><p>The Christian umbrella body also called on Gumi himself to withdraw his statement in the interest of peace and unity in the country.</p><p>CAN went ahead to describe the submissions by Gumi as “unpatriotic and divisive utterances.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49sZqCtnZ56qrqMpqarnV2pv7DBwaWcZpmjYr2iusOenWavkae7tHnHoqRmrJ9iwLWt2GaYsJmpYrOzu8xmq6GdXai8tsDHZqqoraSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ree-drummond-nephew-accident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ree Drummond's Nephew's Accident Caused Some Critical Injuries">&larr;
