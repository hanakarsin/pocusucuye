Not just being a father, but he was like a teammate," Jason Kidd said of his dad.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Alizabeth Swain</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">May 2 2024, Published 4:53 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In the realm of professional basketball, few names resonate as powerfully as that of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Kidd</a>. A maestro on the court, his rise to <a href=#>NBA</a> fame is a tale of talent, perseverance, and the undeniable influence of his upbringing. In 2011, Jason won an NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks. He also won two gold medals in the Olympics in 2000 and 2008. Jason is known as one of the greatest point guards in history.</p><p>The story of Jason's parents is not just a narrative about two individuals but a reflection of the values, support, and guidance that propelled the coach from a young basketball enthusiast into one of the sport's most revered figures.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who are Jason Kidd's parents?</h2><p>Jason's parents were Steve Kidd, an African-American, and Anne Kidd, an Irish-American. In interviews, Jason has shared that Magic Johnson and his father were his idols growing up. While Steve hasn't shared much about the relationship between him and his mother, it's clear that he had a very special relationship with his father.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Jason Kidd signs with the Unversity of California at Berkeley in the presence of, from left, his dad Steve Kidd, coach Frank LaPorte, mom Anne Kidd, and sister Kimberly Kidd</p></figure><p>Jason shared with the official Mavericks website, "My dad was a big part of my life. Not just being a father, but he was like a teammate. He traveled. He got the opportunity because of his job."</p><p>"He was critical of my games, but if you got to know my dad he would talk to anybody," Jason continued. "It didn’t matter if you were the owner of the team or you were someone who was a janitor. He loved to talk and laugh. So for him looking down to see where I got drafted, and today to see where I am as a head coach, I know he’s smiling.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">When did Jason Kidd start playing basketball?</h2><p>Jason was born on March 23, 1973, in San Francisco, California. Up until he was in the second grade, Jason played soccer. But after switching to basketball, he started to play competitively.</p><p>By the time Jason entered his junior year at St. Joseph High School in Alameda, Calif., he had already become a phenomenon on the national basketball scene. Jason was part of the team that led St. Joseph to consecutive state championships.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Real Coach Jason Kidd (@coachjasonkidd)</a></p></figure><p>During his senior year, he was honored with the prestigious Naismith Award, recognizing him as the nation's top high school player. His remarkable <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statistics</a> for the year included an average of 25.0 points, 10.0 assists, 7.0 rebounds, and 7.0 steals per game. Additionally, his exceptional skills on the court earned him the titles of Parade Magazine and USA Today High School Player of the Year.</p><p>In 2018, Jason headlined a 10-member class inducted into the Cal Athletic Hall of Fame. In November 2016, he started The Jason Kidd Scholarship for men's basketball. Now, Jason is the head coach for the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81moqKclGK9or7Ep6us</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kirk-cameron-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kirk Cameron - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
