Here’s a list of the variants.</p><img height=40 width=40 alt="Jamie Lerner - Author" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/dcwXjJZFT/200x200/headshot-1653400328516.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/dcwXjJZFT/200x200/headshot-1653400328516.jpg><p><strong>Spoiler Alert: This article contains spoilers for Episode 5 of </strong><strong>Loki</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>After Episode 5 of <a href=#>Loki</a>, we need a list of Loki variants considering we’ve now met at least seven (yes, seven), and the series has referenced even more Loki variants in the <a href=#>Marvel</a> universe. Between Marvel comics, Norse mythology, and fan theory, there are quite a few ideas surrounding all these Loki variants.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So far, we know that <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston’s Loki</a> is a variant from the “sacred timeline” since Loki takes place after Tom’s Loki steals the tesseract to escape the Avengers. We also meet Sylvie in Loki, who is now pretty much confirmed to be a female Loki variant.</p><p>In Episode 4, after Loki is “pruned” by <a href=#>Ravonna</a>, he comes tête-à-tête with four more Loki variants in an apocalyptic timeline, where he meets even more Loki variants in Episode 5. Plus, in Episode 2, several Loki variants are referenced, so here’s a list to keep them straight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant L1130: Main Loki (Tom Hiddleston)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This is the Loki we know and love, aka Loki Laufeyson. He is the God of Mischief, who bickers with his brother Thor and tries to take over Asgard, as well as Earth. But when he steals the Tesseract during the Time Heist in Avengers: Endgame, he veers off his MCU path to end up at the TVA. In the greater MCU, we love Loki’s transformation into a hero — does the same thing happen in Loki?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant No. 2: Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sylvie doesn’t have a specific variant number according to the TVA, but she is considered a Loki variant. While it seemed possible that she’s actually the Enchantress from the Marvel comics, the reference to her childhood on Asgard makes it clear that she is likely a Loki.</p><p>However, after being torn from her life by the TVA, she took on the persona of Sylvie to become somewhat of a hybrid <a href=#>Lady Loki and Sylvie the Enchantress</a> character in Loki, whose mission it is to get revenge on the TVA.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant No. 3: Classic Loki (Richard E. Grant)</h2><p>Finally, <a href=#>Richard E. Grant</a> is here! We’ve known his arrival in Loki was a long time coming, and now that we know he is “Classic Loki,” we’re free to theorize about what that means. Classic Loki isn’t actually a Marvel comics character, but Richard wears Loki’s first-ever costume from his first comic book appearance in the 1962 Journey into Mystery #85.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As we learn in Episode 5, Classic Loki is actually a version of Loki who survives Avengers: Infinity War by creating an elaborate projection of himself that tricks Thanos, and disguising himself as inanimate debris. After surviving, he realizes he's meant to be alone, and lives out his life in solitude as the self-proclaimed "God of Outcasts."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But, Classic Loki misses his brother, Thor, and escapes his lonely planet, which creates a Nexus event. This suggests that our Loki might not actually die in Infinity War since his survival is not what creates the Nexus event.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant No. 4: Kid Loki (Jack Veal)</h2><p>Kid Loki is actually an extremely exciting addition to the MCU! Kid Loki exists in the comics as a reborn version of Loki after Loki dies at the hand of Thanos. Does this mean we could see more Kid Loki in the MCU after Loki is finished? Most definitely.</p><p>There are big rumors going around that with the introduction of Wanda Maximoff’s sons, Speed and Wiccan, and the confirmation of a Marvel version of <a href=#>Big Hero 6</a>, a <a href=#>Young Avengers</a> movie could be on the horizon.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In Episode 5 of Loki, we learn that Kid Loki is actually the most respected variant of the Void — it's his "kingdom." Why? Well, out of all the Loki variants, Kid Loki is the only one that could kill his brother, Thor, which created his Nexus event that landed him in the Void.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant No. 5: Boastful Loki (DeObia Oparei)</h2><p>Boastful Loki doesn’t actually exist in the comic books, but we have some theories about who he really is. He’s wielding Mjolnir, aka <a href=#>Thor’s hammer</a>, so he could be some sort of Thor and Loki hybrid.</p><p>Upon first glance, Boastful Loki draws several comparisons to the Marvel comics character Sigurd, who takes many forms. Sigurd and Kid Loki actually meet and battle in the comics in Agent of Asgard, so it’s possible Boastful Loki could be somewhat based on this character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>We learn in Episode 5 that Boastful Loki is also just very boastful! He claims to have defeated Iron Man and Captain America to win over all six infinity stones, but no one believes him. It turns out that Boastful Loki actually betrays the other Lokis stuck in the Void to his pal, President Loki, one of the Loki variant "wolves."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant No. 6: Alligator Loki (uncredited CGI alligator)</h2><p>In the hands of Kid Loki is a somewhat adorable and tiny reptile wearing a Loki horned hat. The Loki variants confirm that Alligator Loki is indeed a Loki variant, which our Loki finds strange, but not that strange in comparison to everything else he's dealing with.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although Episode 5 doesn't explain how Alligator Loki came to be an alligator (maybe he's just from a universe that's only alligators?), it does explain his Nexus event.</p><p>When Boastful Loki boasts about his six infinity stones and the other Loki variants call his bluff, he says, "At least I didn't go after the wrong neighbor's cat!" and Alligator Loki makes his attack, so we can assume that's how Alligator Loki ends up at the TVA.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Loki Variant No. 7: President Loki</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In Episode 5, we meet President Loki, who leads a rogue band of Lokis to scavenge and attempt to take charge of the Void. President Loki actually comes from a 2016 Vote Loki comic which actually borrows from Journey Into Mystery #85, which shares its name with Loki Episode 5. The comic was a parody mocking the 2016 election, but Loki unfortunately does not win the presidency.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bonus Loki variants add to the list.</h2><p>Although the above list of Loki variants are the only Loki variants we’ve met so far in Loki (that we know of), Episode 2 of Loki references some other Loki variants that have already been captured by the TVA. We first see Frost Giant Loki (L6792), who looks just like Loki but is blue. Is this a Loki who’s embraced his Frost Giant heritage?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>We also see Cyclist Loki (L1237), who is holding the Tour de France’s Coupe Omnisports trophy, which was notoriously stolen in 2018 and never recovered, so this is another instance of Loki explaining a real-world mystery, similar to the disappearance of <a href=#>D.B. Cooper</a>. We also see Troll Loki, Pan Loki, and Viking Loki, who we don’t know too much about, although they could be references to the comics.</p><p>In Loki Episode 5, we also meet several Lokis that are following President Loki, although we have no information as to who these Lokis are, although they could be any creation inspired by the comics, fan parodies, or any new ideas.</p><p>Loki is turning out to be not just about Loki but about all the variants of Loki. And who knows? We may be adding a few more variants to the list as Loki develops.</p><p>New episodes of Loki are released every Wednesday on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobystYyvmKuhkaPBtHnLoqqt</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./418746-cleophas-malala-dares-raila-face-william-ruto-alone-he-will-lose-before-election-day-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cleophas Malala Dares Raila to Face William Ruto Alone: &amp;quot;He Will Lose Before Election Day&amp;quot;">&larr;
