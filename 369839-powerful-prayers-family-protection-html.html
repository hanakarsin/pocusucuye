Many people turn to prayer when they are going through troubled times, when they want to thank God for whatever they have achieved, or as a routine. Many Christians make it a habit to pray at a certain time of the day every day. This helps with their spiritual life and journey. Having a prayerful family is a blessing for those that believe. Prayers for family is one way of showing that you care for your loved ones.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/435a497bcc3ba89e.jpeg><p class=align-left>As a believer, you are not to judge others, but pray that God guides you as you live through tempting times.

Tight and loving families make great members of society. The love that is shared among family members is distributed to others. Praying for your family unity is key in ensuring that you continue with the togetherness you have been having even as people grow older and start their own families.</p>Dear Lord, we come before you this beautiful day grateful for the gift of life and family. You know every one of us more than we know ourselves and continue to bless us as we enjoy the life you have given us. I'm praying for our father as the head of the house may you give him peace and strength as he provides. I bring our mother before you today. She is the best mother I could ever ask for and for that reason I ask you to look after her in all days of her life. I love my siblings and would do anything for them. Dear God, I ask you to continue existing in our midst. As we share peace and unity, I pray for nothing other than togetherness in this family. You know how much we need each other. You are the holy one and understand why it is important for families to work in unity. Grant us that dear father, grant us the unity we so much need, as it is one of the pillars In this family. May the unity we have spread to other people we interact with outside this family. Help us share our unity with friends, neighbours, and colleagues. We believe in you, God, for there is nothing impossible in your eyes.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f409a0fa5f3c2260.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful benediction prayers for church services and meetings</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Prayer for someone you love to come back</p><h2>Prayers for family problems</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0ff3725b74311d84.jpeg><p class=align-left>Every family experiences internal conflicts. Family problems are brought about by issues like finances or lack thereof, misunderstanding between parents and children, ego, lack of respect, and betrayal. A family that prays together and holds talks regularly can pray their problems away even as they work on solving them.</p>Jehovah Jireh we come before you this day again, asking you to intervene in everything we do. As a Christian family, we do everything according to your will. We worship you, dear Jehova, for you are the only true God. I ask you to grace this earth. Our family has been going through trials and tribulations for so long. We have tried everything, and now we come before you to get guidance. We know that you listen to your children's cries, and that is why we bow before you asking for help. Be with us during our desperate times for you are the only supreme power we can trust. Dear God, please help us solve our problems amicably. We are here today asking for repentance. May you absolve us of our wrongdoings for we are shameful sinners. I pray that after all this turmoil, our hearts may have the peace that you intend us to have. Oh Lord, we have been through this path before. You showed us your power, and that is why we come back. I ask for forgiveness if I have betrayed you in any way. I come before you on behalf of my brothers and sisters. The devil has led them astray and created misunderstandings among them. Please come through for us, for we are weak beings. I thank you for listening to my prayer.

Many dangerous things include people, natural disasters, and other unexplained factors. To keep your family safe, you have to pray and try and stay in secured areas.</p>There is nothing that can protect this house other than the blood of your son Jesus Christ. My enemies have been trying to get to my family and me for the longest time. I pray that you may stop them before they hit us, dear Lord. We are vulnerable at this point and would want to stay in peace. Protect us from evil eyes, protect us from those that want to harm us, protect us from those that lead us into temptations, protect us from the vices of the world, oh Lord. You are the only father I know. I trust that you have kept a place for me in heaven. While still here, father, please help me live a free life far from fear. I have seen you work miracles on your children. You never fail to fulfil your promises. Oh Lord, no one comes next to you. You are always there for those that trust in you, and that is why I make a plea to you today. Please protect my family and me from the evil men outside. They only want to destroy the good things we have achieved as a family. Send them away and keep us safe, dear Lord. I ask this through your son Jesus Christ Amen.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2f8ddcff1481d034.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15+ best closing prayers for church services and meetings</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Powerful prayer for healthy baby and pregnancy</p><h2>Prayer for family and friends</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f409a0fa5f3c2260.jpeg><p class=align-left>Friends and family make us. The saying no man is an island is true as no human can survive without co-existing with others. As a believer, it is an act of kindness when you pray for your friends and family. These are the people you spend a good amount of your time with. It would not hurt to pray for them, too even as you pray for yourself. You can also read good Bible verse for family.</p>Holy God, we are thankful for the friends and family you have put our lives. No man can exist alone, and that is why you thought it wise to give him a helper for all the days of his life. Abba Father, I present to you my friends who have been there for me during my ups and downs. I could never ask for any other group of friends, dear Lord. I pray that you bless each of them. Give them good health, pour in all the success they need in the business they run, make them witness their victory, and that of their families. Be with them every time they call for your help, for they deserve everything nice in this world. I thank you for my family, dear Lord, I praise you for making me part of this family. They know my weakness and my strength. They understand me when I break down and are always there to offer me emotional support. I ask you God of all nations to protect my family. I pray that they may live for many years. I do not know what I can do without these amazing people that you put in mt life. I pray for all heads of families, and the head of my family, dear God. Give them wisdom as they lead their families. Make us follow your word and pray together every day, as our spiritual life needs to be restored.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b89f97269fdafea6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful prayer points for church workers on Sunday morning</span></p></a><h2>Prayer for family health</h2><p class=align-left>They say that health is wealth. This is true as, without a strong immunity, your body becomes weak and prone to all types of illnesses. As you eat healthy, exercise and get enough sleep, remember to also pray for your health and that of your family. There is no joy in having everything in the world if your health and that of your family is wanting.</p>When you made the world, you left it so pure and clean. We appreciate everything that you put in this world, dear God. Father of all nations, I ask you to make the earth pure again and clean it of all sickness. People are dying because of mysterious illnesses. Viruses are killing your people every day. I ask you, Lord, to intervene and make everything stop. I especially make this short prayer for my family today. May you keep everyone healthy. Protect us from all diseases brought by the spread of bacteria and viruses. Clean us with the blood of your only son. I come before you as your child, bringing together all my loved ones, protect us, dear Lord, from all the bad things happening in the world. I pray for the doctors and nurses that take care of sick patients. God, please give them the strength they need as they attend to sick people. Give them your power so as they treat the patients, they may heal too. I pray for my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts, dear father, may you free from all illnesses. Clean us, dear Lord for we are sick. The dirt we collect in our daily living is costing us both our physical and spiritual health. I pray trusting in Jesus' holy name Amen.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/54befd88cac5756b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short morning prayers for friends to bless their day</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 inspirational prayers for healthcare providers</p><h2>Prayers for family loss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/11e80af50377d791.jpeg><p class=align-left>Loss can come in any form. Loss of a job, a friend, property, or even death mark some of the worst experiences human beings go through. Everyone has their way of dealing with loss. When a family lose something, everyone becomes sad and emotional. This gets worse when it is death. The permanent departure of someone you used to see every day can break you into pieces. That is why it is important to pray to God, asking for strength and peace when you are mourning.</p>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, I come before you today, asking you to forgive me for the sins that I have committed. Dear God, I thank you for everything you have offered me. I am lucky to be among your favourite children. I have never lacked ever since I committed my life to you, dear God. I lift your name higher every day for you are the only God I believe in. I'm praying for my family, especially during this difficult time. No one saw this coming, but your wish has to be fulfilled. Jehova father, you are the one who gives and the only one who takes it away. We ask you, God, to remain in our midst as we mourn the death of our brother. We believe that he is in a better place right now. Let your will be done God for you are all-knowing. I pray for each member of this family. I bring them before you, dear God. Make their hearts light as we deal with this loss. I'm praying for all the loved ones that are mourning this death. Please see them through these difficult times. Make us understand that death is only the beginning of another chapter. Help us, oh holy one, at this hour of need. We are grateful for everything in this life, oh Lord. Thank you, God, of all creation. I make this powerful prayer through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15+ powerful good morning prayers for him to wake up to</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A family that prays together stays together. As a believer, do not be ashamed of praying. The more you pray, the more your wishes are granted. God loves it when his people talk to him through prayer. He listens and answers you when the right time comes. Make it part of your schedule to pray as you work. Praying is not only brings healing but is also comforting. Prayers for family will bring you closer to those that matter in your life.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Powerful prayers for financial breakthrough and debt cancellation</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlXJvbHFdpby4sdGfrKVloKeuurHRrGSfmZ2eubp5z6umrZ2Tqbawuo2hq6ak</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./48151-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UNILAG students bar NANS reps from entering the university.">&larr;
